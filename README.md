# Boilerplate Rails app

Just another boilerplate rails app. Comes preconfigured with several aweseome gems to make building UIs a lot easier.

The UI gems include:

* Boostrap
* Bourbon
* Font Awesome

On top of that `guard` is included. Together with the [http://livereload.com/](http://livereload.com/) browser extension the app can automatically reload whenever you change stuff in the UI.

For tests `minitest` is set as the default test engine.
